# keras_nn_for_predicting_temperature

A basic neural network with Keras for predicting temperature on a day from dew point, wind, sea level pressure and date.
This code in this state has no real use, but it was a good way to learn about the basics of neural networks.

For improvement:
  - adding a dropout layer
  - increasing training data size
    - instead of monthly -> weekly
  - optimizing the layers, batch size, epochs
  - using other data for training
